## 2026-03-10 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Renamify Panel
**Vulnerability:** Found an XSS vulnerability in `fd-vscode/src/webview-html.ts` where untrusted node IDs (`p.oldId` and `p.newId`) from the extension's `.fd` files were directly interpolated into `row.innerHTML` in the Renamify panel.
**Learning:** Even though the source is internal extension files, untrusted input rendered directly as `innerHTML` causes an XSS injection risk.
**Prevention:** Avoid `innerHTML` for dynamically generating DOM nodes. Always use safer DOM APIs like `document.createElement()` and `textContent` when rendering untrusted or user-controlled data.
